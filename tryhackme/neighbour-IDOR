Difficulty: Easy
Technique: IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

## 🧠 Overview
This challenge demonstrates a classic IDOR vulnerability where a user can access another user’s data by manipulating a URL parameter. The flag was exposed simply by changing a value in the query string.

---

### 🚀 Exploitation Steps
1. Initial Access
Navigated to the challenge at:
http://ip/
A simple login form was shown.

---

### 2. Source Code Inspection
Opened the HTML source of the login page.

Found a developer comment revealing test credentials:

<!-- use guest:guest credentials until registration is fixed. 
     "admin" user account is off limits!!!!! -->
This suggested:

There’s a valid user (guest) to test with.

An admin user exists and might be reachable.

---

### 3. Login and Network Observation
Logged in with:

Username: guest
Password: guest
Opened DevTools → Network Tab.

Saw this GET request to fetch user data:

GET /profile.php?user=guest

---

### 4. IDOR Exploitation
Changed the parameter in the URL from guest to admin:

GET /profile.php?user=admin
It worked — no authentication check blocked the request.

The flag was shown on the page.

## 🔍 What I Learned
🔎 Dev comments in HTML can expose sensitive test credentials.

🔧 Applications often use user-controllable parameters in requests.

❗ If those parameters aren’t validated server-side, it’s an IDOR.

👀 Always inspect network traffic after login or important actions.

💡 IDORs can be incredibly simple to exploit, yet highly impactful.
